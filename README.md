SGS CI Tools
============

`ci-tools` is collection of various small scripts and tools for [@SGSGermany](https://github.com/SGSGermany)'s continuous integration (CI) pipelines.

All tools are highly adapted to their specific purpose and thus likely not suitable for others to use. Anyway, if you want to, you can, it's FOSS after all.
